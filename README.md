Stratospheric ballooning project from Magalhaes family

## Objectives

* Ascend to 20-30km altitude
* Video record the entire flight
* Measure internal temperature

## Materials

* Raspberry pi zero
* Radio transmitter (Radiometrix HX1 144.8mhz)
* GPS receiver (uBLOX MAX-M8C Pico)
* 3300mah lithium ion batterie 18650
* DHT22 temperature sensor module
* Raspberry Pi camera V2 (with infrared filter)

## Case

* **material**: styrofoam (esferovite)
* cut wall with a router (designar) with holes for 3d printed rods (+structural strength)
* glue wall with internal rods

## Balloon

* Weather baloon 800 - <https://www.stratoflights.com/en/shop/weather-balloon-800/>
* The Weather Balloon 800 is particularly suitable for beginners and can carry a payload of up to 800g (28.2oz). This is perfect for projects with one camera. The maximum altitude at which the balloon bursts is 30,000m (14mi).

## Helium

* Assuming 500g payload we need 1 bootle of 20l of helium at 200bar (price: 300€)

## Important

* in theory it is necessary to have a license to operate a radio on aprs frequency 
* in theory 10km is the max range of Radiometrix HX1 radio
* it is necessary to encode messages (modulation/demodulation) and send them on APRS frequency

## mission 1

Name: Chicken Ship
Weight (max 500g): Styrofoam (esferovite) box (225g) all elements (400g)
